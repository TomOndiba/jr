User Status v1.0
Brett Profitt

User Status overlays status icons on profile images, giving an easy way to 
identify online users, new users, and more.

**INSTALLATION**
	* Unzip the file to the elgg/mods/ directory.
	* Go to your Elgg tools administration section, find the new mod, and 
	  enable it.
	* Customize the settings if desired.

**NOTES**
	* Enabling too many icons will start looking weird.  4 is about the max
	  right now.

**CREDITS**
	* Concept based upon "Online Mark" plugin by Dirk Pelzer.

**CHANGES**

v1.0 (March 18, 2009)
	* Initial release.

Demerits v1.0b1
Brett Profitt

Provides a way of assigning users demerits with consequences for users who
accumulate demerits.

** REQUIREMENTS **
In order for demerits to properly expire, the "expirationdate" plugin must 
be installed and cron must correctly configured.

** INSTALLATION **
	* Unzip the file to the elgg/mods/ directory.
	* Go to your Elgg tools administration section, find the new tool and 
	  enable it.
	* Customize the settings if desired.

** CONFIGURATION **
Once you have enabled demerits, check the options for when expire demerits.
You can also choose to have reported content automatically add demerits.

Consequences can be added by going to the admin page, clicking on the "Demerits"
link on the left sidebar, and then going to "List Consequences."  There are no
consequences by default, so you will want to add a new consequence.

A consequence will take effect only after X many demerits have been accumulated
by a user.  Consequences stack, so you have have multiple consequences for the
same number of demerits.

Currently 4 actions are supported for consequences: notify, suspend, ban, and 
delete.  

Notify allows you to send a notification to a user using Elgg's internal 
notification system.  If the user has configured this to email, then it will
also be sent through email.  The "to" field *must* be a valid Elgg user.  You
can use a few variables in the notification action:
%USERNAME% will be replaced by the demerit owner's user name.
%USER_FULLNAME% will be replaced by the demerit owner's display name.
%USER_EMAIL% will be replaced by the user's email address.
%DEMERIT% will be replaced by a formatted view of the demerit that caused 
this action.
%DEMERIT_HISTORY% will be replaced by a formatted view of all past confirmed
demerits.

Suspend will suspend a user for X many days.

Delete and ban will respecively delete and ban the user who has the
demerit.  Delete should be used with caution, as the user will not be 
recoverable.

A standard sequence of consequences might look like this:

	(Send a warning to the user)
	After 3 confirmed demerits
	Notify 
	To: %USERNAME% 
	Subject: Too many demerits
	Message: %USER_FULLNAME%,
		You have received 3 demerits for bad behavior.  After one more
		your account will be suspended for 7 days.

		Thanks,
		MyElggSite Admin

	(Send a notice to the user)
	After 4 confirmed demerits
	Notify
	To: %USERNAME%
	Subject: Account suspended
	Message: %USER_FULLNAME%,

		See below for a list of the offenses.

		%DEMERIT_HISTORY%

		Your account will automatically be reactivated after 7 days.
